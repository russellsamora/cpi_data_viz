We live half a block outside of the sought-after Penn Alexander catchment and across the street from Lea Elementary. I am reading tutor for Lea Elementary.  In order to become a tutor, I had to submit three background checks that cost me $60 and many hours of legwork.  When I was a substitute teacher in Sweden, I clicked on one automated, electronic link, and at no charge, the school retrieved my criminal record.  If the school district is going to rely on volunteerism to beautify and improve their schools, they will need to streamline the volunteer permitting system.  It is my understanding that if I wanted to fix the broken basketball hoop at Lea, I would have to pay for hourly liability insurance to volunteer.  It would be less paperwork and less expensive to buy a gun in this country.  That is sad.The schools are broken because the city has failed to enforce its tax code.  Philadelphia has $515 M in delinquent property taxes owed, most of which would be paid to support the public school system.  More funding could be had from enforcing ""broken window"" policies which fine absentee landlords and put vacant and abandoned properties up for sheriff sale in a TIMELY and transparent manner that allows people to bid up prices (as opposed to the city sitting on residential vacancies in the hopes of one day bundling them to sell cheaply to a developer).  The city and state, instead of collecting and spending taxes on schools, have slashed the public school budget, starving schools for funding to the point that they cannot function and are in such disrepair that they are slated for closure.  The city and sheriff_s sale office should be held accountable for these missing funds.  The more we starve our school system for funding, consolidate under enrolled schools, and cut programs and building upkeep funding, the more these neighborhood schools will deteriorate taking surrounding neighborhoods with them.  There is high demand for Penn Alexander.  Housing prices in the catchment reflect this with a $100K premium.  There could be high demand for Lea Elementary.  Instead, the current administration is charting a path that will overburden already under-funded schools.  Middle-income neighbors, like me, who can afford to flee the city_s school system will do it- taking our tax dollars with us.  Now is that time that people, young, professional, dual-income families WANT to live in Philadelphia.  If the city can_t or won_t turn over their abandoned and tax-delinquent properties in a timely and transparent fashion, collect and spend the $515 million owed on schools, you will lose us and only further perpetuate a system of inequality on future generations.http://www.philly.com/philly/news/special_packages/157887355.html?fb_action_ids=10151204531620233&fb_action_types=og.likes&fb_source=aggregation&fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582(image: design charette for Lea Elementary's new playground)",3,0,-2,-0.016666667,8,2358,124,"9Anyone with a 4 year old leaves... the schools are atrocious.

A few years back, the Philadelphia Planning Commission and Walnut Hill Neighborhood Coordination Strategy Team issued a report describing several recommendations for Transit Oriented Development in Walnut Hill, centered around the 46th & Market el station.  TOD makes PERFECT sense for this sector, which extends all the way to Walnut street. Their major recommendations included: decrease auto-oriented uses (gas stations, car washes, etc), which are at their core inconsistent with transit oriented development, and which includes re-zoning areas where needed to allow mixed uses of residential, office and retail; implement the Transit Revitalization Investment District (which promotes alternative transportation modes and walkable communities); improving the streetscape to make it more pedestrian friendly/walkable (pedestrian lighting - already underway, I believe; tree planting, sidewalk maintenance, curb bump-outs, buffers between pedestrians and traffic) and enhancing community garden public space.

They do have parking there, but it is actually placed under and above the stores in the complex, with commercial properties along the majority of the street level.

I've also wondered why there's no bus connection continuing west from the end of the 34 trolley line, towards Lansdowne, Clifton Heights, etc. That would be useful for shopping.Recent efforts to make some of the intersections long Baltimore more pedestrian-friendly have helped. More could be done with traffic calming on residential streets. Oakland CA did some interesting things a couple decades ago to break up certain smaller streets and concentrate through traffic on larger routes; I don't know how that as worked out, but it seems that it would fit in well here since we already have so many streets that are not continuous. Planted bump-outs at corners would slow traffic, improve pedestrian safety, and create opportunities to capture run-off, which the Water Department is working on. They could create obstacles for bicyclists, but I think they'd be less of a bike hazard than parked cars on corners, which we have to deal with all the time. The multiple-bike-parking space in front of Mariposa Co-op is great.

This kind of smaller option seems to have really been discouraged in the recent past by Penn's support for employees buying in the neighborhood, which encouraged sale of undivided houses and drove up prices. I do think that both new construction and re-use of existing spaces could support these kinds of living spaces. The Apple Lofts project sounded like a step in the right direction.How about the empty buildings & lots along the 5000 & 5100 blocks of Baltimore. Also, since the recent fire I've been thinking about how the 4900 block of Baltimore has gradually replaced 3-story buildings with residences above commercial space, with single-story commercial. That's good residential space lost.I also wish there could be some sort way to adapt zoning to encourage car-free living, car-sharing, etc. As long as multiple residences have to incorporate off-street parking, it's difficult to work that into a neighborhood like Cedar Park. There are certainly problems with crowded street parking, but I think we should find ways to encourage fewer cars rather than more parking.
