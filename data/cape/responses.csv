People come here because of a deep connection to the environment; it touches their souls in some aesthetic way, or they derive great pleasure in recreation directly tied to the water (e.g. boating, fishing, swimming, surfing) or indirectly (birding, photography, painting) or enhanced by the location (biking, hiking, writing). Their livelihood may be directly or indirectly tied to those resources (fishing industry, research). Much of the rest of the economy is focused around catering to those who come for the above reasons: restaurants, health facilities, services, seaside related retail.  If the resources are not proactively protected due to initial costs, it can become prohibitively expensive to undo damage once it has gotten to a point of difficult return. Here is a photo of a Chatham seal from 2010.  I have been visiting it since then and see it a few times a year when I am on the Cape. I did see it this past spring when I was at the pier. It's neck has been tangled in fishing line since before 2010, according to the Marine Mammal folks.

Recreation opportunities:  Of course, if the quality of water in the ponds, rivers, and ocean declines, the myriad of recreational opportunities, from shell fishing to kayaking, swimming or just enjoying clean beaches, will correspondingly decline.
