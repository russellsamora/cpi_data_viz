Young adults who struggle with homelessness don't only struggle with inadequate housing but may also be coping with mental, emotional, or physical health problems, substance abuse, violence, and family struggles. Every human shares the same basic necessities such as food, water, shelter, warmth, and hygiene. According to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, without these basic needs, an individual cannot focus on further achievements such as employment, stability, health, resources, relationships, self-esteem, and inner talents. Many people who experience homelessness include young adults who are given limited options to seek their full potential.      In fact, the concern for unaccompanied youth homelessness in Massachusetts is being acknowledged more today than it ever has. There is a bill known as the Act Providing Housing Support Services for Unaccompanied Homeless Youth that will be addressed at the State House on February 27. This bill is being addressed in hopes to reduce youth homelessness with a series of improvements such as increased housing and support services that will be aimed specifically for unaccompanied youth as well as bettering stability, education, physical and mental health.This bill also suggests rather than serving young adults 22 and younger, to extend to the age of 24 and younger.    This population of young adults is difficult to count because they don•À_t always identify themselves as homeless. Not only that but they are tracked by reports from schools, shelters, and other social service agencies. If the young adult isn•À_t in-rolled in any of these services then they will go unnoticed. According to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, there is an estimated 6,000 high school students that are homeless on their own. According to state educational officials, there is an estimated 13,090 homeless students in which 735 of them are defined as unaccompanied.       In Salem, Massachusetts there is a Day program called Journeys of Hope that serves homeless young adults from the ages of 18-23. There is currently 82 young adults in Salem that seek help through Journeys of hope today. In addition, 29% of the 47 students who attend Salem Community Charter School in Downtown Salem are housing unstable or homeless. The only shelter in the area that provides a bed to sleep in at night is a shelter called Lifebridge. Even so, this shelter is for people of all ages that are struggling with homelessness and many other issues.   Young adults need their own space to build themselves from the ground up.  With the obstacles they are already facing, they need somewhere temporarily stable to feel comfortable and safe to sleep at. They meet numerous strangers day by day but what they will really benefit form is a place surrounded by other young adults facing the same challenges. Not just that, but they need to be assured that they are safe and their belongings will be free from harm. If that is not provided then young adults are more likely to avoid shelters and put themselves in more risk. Without a secure youth based environment, most homeless young adults across the world will continue to lack personal growth.By: Mariah DoranCome support us at the State house on Wednesday, February 27, 2013 at 9:00am.

In the fall of 2009, a Dominican friend of mine and I were going door-to-door in The Point, looking for senior citizens to survey them about how the Salem Council on Aging could be of service. Our goal was to knock on every last door of every single residence, but we didn't anticipate how forbidding the large brick apartment buildings could be. We left some of our flyers at the main entrances, where we could, but decided not to venture inside to go through the hallways knocking on doors. We felt intimidated about the thought of going deep inside one of those apartment buildings and out of sight. In reflecting on my own feelings, I wasn't afraid of being verbally or physically threatened inside the building, but I was nervous about knocking on doors of people I assumed -- maybe incorrectly -- wouldn't have appreciated their day being interrupted. I pictured us simply being sneered at or having doors shut in our faces. I guess it boiled down to this: The inhospitable feeling we had from the outside of the building made us feel there would be inhospitable people living inside.",,0,0,-1,0,2396,154,"I can remember my last drive through The Point exactly. Every Thursday evening I drive a Salem Council on Aging van to take someone home. I take a left from Lafayette Street at Wendy's restaurant onto Peabody Street. I drop my passenger off at an apartment building on Peabody Street, across from what I think is an electrical facility. Then I take a right onto Congress and another right onto Harbor, crossing Lafayette at the new set of traffic lights. The COA van isn't very wide, but I always feel cramped on Peabody and Harbor streets. With cars parked on both sides, I proceed very slowly, afraid someone will carelessly fling open a car door in my path. If I could change anything, it would be to widen the roads or restrict parking to only one side. I know the latter suggestion would create a severe parking issue for residents in the large apartment buildings, but -- get this -- I'd create 24-hour valet parking jobs at each of those buildings. Imagine!  It would be just like in New York City where there are huge apartment buildings and hundreds of residents, but not nearly enough space to park all their cars. You pull your car up right out front, some guy in a red jacket holds your door open for you and then drives your car to a designated garage. Pretty fancy, right? OK, so maybe that's not realistic, but it's what I'd change if I could. And while I'm on Peabody Street, maybe I should also mention I'd tear down the electrical facility and fill that lot with a new Boys & Girls Club or a supermarket.

I've never been to the Brisas del Caribe or the place on the east side of Congress Street that seems to change hands on a monthly basis. I've eaten at the Tipico on Congress Street a few times, but my American palate would most often point me in the direction of Wendy's.

I suspect there are lots of businesses tucked away in Shetland Park, although I have no idea exactly what and it seems like such a cold and unwelcoming complex of buildings I wouldn't even be inclined to explore it.

I know the entire City is dense, accommodating more than 40,000 people in about eight square miles of space. That's an average of about 5,000 people per square mile, but breathing room in The Point is much harder to come by. In that neighborhood, the average is more than 12,000 people per square mile. Adding to the sense of compression is a vague feeling I get as a driver. With so many one-way streets, I get the feeling that if I can find my way into The Point, I'm going to stuggle to find my way out. Overall, The Point feels like a thicket of wild rose bushes to me -- a neighborhood that has sometimes yields attractive blooms, but one in which people get become snagged, disoriented and trapped.

It's long seemed to me, however, that The Point is viewed as a world unto itself, a place outsiders simply don't pay much attention to or in which not a lot of time and energy is focused. People don't do things that are clearly detrimental to The Point, but they don't do much to do anything of benefit to it either. The Point is just, well ... there. This is an extension of my feeling that The Point is isolated, the word I used as my answer to the very first challenge in Mission 1.

A lack of parking potential could pose a problem, but the league's representative likes the location and feels the presence of a minor league team could bring new vitality to The Point, along with a stronger sense of neighborhood identity. ""The community at large would benefit, too,"" said the league rep. ""A minor league baseball team would give residents a rallying point, and I think it would be a hit with nearby residents.

For starters, I think people are generally more inclined to feel and express pride in places when they're geographically larger. In other words, as I think about this question for myself. I've never sensed much pride in my street, but there's a little more potential for pride when I consider my neighborhood, and even more when I think about my hometown (Morristown, N.J.) I have even more pride, and express it more readily, for my home state. Maybe it has to do with feeling more pride when we feel part of a bigger group of people. I've become increasingly proud of the U.S. and its place in the global community, lately, as I meet and communicate online with people in other parts of the world. Our country has its flaws, of course, but many people worldwide long to come to America because the know we enjoy freedoms not available to them. Everything is relative, right? OK, now back to the question! I took a little pride in my neighborhood because there was a national historic site -- Washington's headquarters at the Ford Mansion -- at the end of my street. I thought that was pretty cool, although I took it for granted and never visited it. I was more proud of my hometown for the role it played in the American Revolution, when its high school sports teams succeeded and when I learned about famous people who lived there -- like two presidents' wives, cartoonist Thomas Nast, Detroit Tigers pitchers Rick Porcello and the Craig of criagslist, Craig Newmark. I think I'd have been more proud of my neighborhood if there had been more obvious interactions between neighbors. The kids played together frequently at a local playground, but we never had block parties or came together to rally in support of any worthwhile causes. Neighbors stayed pretty much to themselves when I was growing up in Morristown in the '60s, maybe because it was a very controversial and divisive decade.",,4,1,"For me, pride comes from living history.

Video clips of spectacular diving catches and walk-off home runs were played in my head every day, even though I rarely did either in reality. A baseball field, to me, is a place where hope and dreams are encouraged to play. Baseball is a sport that requires teamwork -- people cooperating and working together toward a common goal. It is also the only team sport in which time is not a factor. Time will never diminish or limit your team's chances of succeeding. There's no clock to watch.
